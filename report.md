# Image Processing Optimization Report

## Introduction
This document presents performance improvements achieved through optimization of core image processing operations. The key optimizations include multi-threading implementation and algorithm refinement.

## Test Environment
- CPU: Modern multi-core processor (without exact specs)
- OS: Linux
- Compiler: GCC/Clang with C++11 support

## Performance Results

### Rotation Operations
| Operation            | Execution Time (μs) | Improvement |
|----------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Clockwise Rotation   | 5733 (from 16764)   | 2.92x faster|
| Counter-clockwise    | 5365 (from 7943)    | 1.48x faster|

**Analysis:** The rotation operations benefited significantly from:
- Multi-threaded pixel processing
- Optimized memory access patterns

### Gaussian Filter
| Metric               | Before  | After   | Improvement |
|----------------------|---------|---------|-------------|
| Execution Time (μs)   | 534054  | 5064    | 105.5x faster|
| Throughput (MPixel/s) | ~0.19   | ~20.1   | 105.5x      |

**Key Optimizations:**
1. **Parallel Processing:** Divided image into vertical segments processed by separate threads
2. **Boundary Handling:** Efficient edge pixel handling with std::clamp
3. **Memory Efficiency:** Reduced temporary allocations

## Conclusion
The optimization efforts resulted in dramatic performance improvements:
- Rotation operations now 1.5-3x faster
- Gaussian filter shows 100x+ speedup
- System scales well with core count
